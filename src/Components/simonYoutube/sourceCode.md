# Learn React Hooks by Coding the Simon Game

This project was quite a challenge for me. I was able to work on the visual part of the game, but I had a hard time figuring out how to make the game work.

That's when I decided to learn React Hooks. I had heard about them, but I had never used them before. I had to learn them in order to make the game work.

I follow along a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoA_qDW5FyQ) and I was able to make the game work.
